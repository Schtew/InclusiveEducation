## Data Preparation
### Set up the project by downloading the "Syllabus data Extraction and Review" Date coding - Mixed 2-15 sheet as a csv in our shared drive.
### Add a new folder in this directory called "data" and add the csv to that folder.
### After this, you can run the DataCleaning.py file and you will get a json file in the data folder.

## Open AI Key
### You will need to get an OpenAI api key and add it to your os environment variables as "OPENAI_API_KEY" to run the code in the ModelTrainer.py file.
